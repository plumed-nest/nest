  This contribution refers to the following paper ["Unravelling the origins of ice nucleation on organic crystals"](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/sc/c8sc02753f#!divAbstract) by Gabriele C. Sosso, Thomas F. Whale, Mark A. Holden, Philipp Pedevilla, Benjamin J. Murray and Angelos Michaelides, published in Chemical Science, Vol. 9, Pag. 8077-8088 (2018). A working (he said confidently...) example of a single FFS shoot can be found in EXAMPLE. This includes the plumed.dat file. The PLUMED version needed is a custom one, and can be found in PLUMED_FFS_CHL.
